The aim of this project is to prepare a tidy data set that can be used for analysis later.

The data can be found at:

Note that before running the script run_analysis.R, you should install the package data.table and dplyr 

The tasks are as follows:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.

5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
